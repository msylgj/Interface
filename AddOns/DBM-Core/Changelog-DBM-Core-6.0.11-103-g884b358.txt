subversion:
	- nbluewiz via svn r12432: # little LoadMod tweak. there are more things to go.
	- nbluewiz via svn r12431: # oops fix stupid.
	- nbluewiz via svn r12430: # filter army of the dead on target scanning.
	- Omega via svn r12429: Add nil check for targetName
	- Omega via svn r12428: Fix spam issue where timer for mark of chaos might end and mark of chaos 1 second late, causing double taunt spam (bad warning for accelerated assault taunt 0.5 sec before mark of chaos goes out)
	- nbluewiz via svn r12427: # koKR update.
	- Omega via svn r12426: BRF
	- Omega via svn r12425: Delete a ton of redundant warnings. DBM biggest complaint is spam and i agree. In fact most people i ask say same thing. No need for special warning and regular warnings that happen at same time and say the SAME THING. In this update, removed all general warnings that are just duplicates of existing special warnings. Kept general warnings that do not have special warnings or provide actual important information like target names or stack count.
	- Omega via svn r12424: Support option version directly in AddBoolOption. So that mods like margok can reset option defaults. Since I was bad and made everything on by default when i consolidated. Updated announce option defaults on Margok Fix invalid spellid on margok Increased checknearby size as a small safety net to people being right on border, so they know to still check how close. Reduce tank swap spam some more.
	- Omega via svn r12423: increase reqeust timers time, still too fast for some
	- Omega via svn r12422: Couple fixes
	- Omega via svn r12421: Shadow Council
	- nbluewiz via svn r12420: # koKR update.
	- Omega via svn r12419: Fix auto accept for people who have "show offline guildies" enabled.
	- Omega via svn r12418: Fix error
	- Omega via svn r12417: Invasion mod doesn't load, more debug to figure out why
	- Omega via svn r12416: Fix another bad option default
	- Omega via svn r12415: bump BW version
	- Omega via svn r12414: Fix bad option default
	- Omega via svn r12413: Fix a bug where accelerated assault warnings would not fire if mark of chaos timer returns 0 (expired, or disabled)
	- Omega via svn r12412: Should be functional invasion mod loading
	- nbluewiz via svn r12411: # Fix rare lua error when loading skin. # koKR update.
	- Omega via svn r12410: Add NewRPTimer Different from NewCombatTimer because combattimer means boss auto pull. Like galakras, Norushen. NewRPTimer means boss activates, but not engage, like garrosh, kargath bladefist, etc.
	- Omega via svn r12409: and this
	- Omega via svn r12408: Not actually functional yet. Just an invasions mod stub. need to find a clean way to load it using scenario update or zone changed or something. need to do /eventtrace next scenario to see best event for transition from garrison to scenario garrison for loadmod.
	- Omega via svn r12407: Add dispel voice to margok Added special soon voice to brackenspore use better voice for MC on koragh use voice for afk health warning if available, falling back to cthun if no VP installed.
	- Omega via svn r12406: Foundry too
	- Omega via svn r12405: Move tank filter to core. turn tank voice alerts on by default for all. Will behave like Taunt special warnings now. Far more friendly to users to constantly switch between dps and tank roles. Possibly less friendly to healers who might want swaptank warnings, but those are the ones likely to disable the tank filter option for the taunt warnings too.
	- TOM_RUS via svn r12404: ruRU update
	- Omega via svn r12403: Add DBM.Options.AlwaysPlayVoice as well to that tank check, so nothing is excluded from it.
	- Omega via svn r12402: of course works better when you set fire active = true
	- Omega via svn r12401: #Koragh *Don't close range frame on arcane removed if fire is active *Don't close range frame on fire removed if arcane is active. #Twin Ogron *Add a voice alert to stack for enfeebling Roar (may need to tweak timing a little if it doesn't play well, but 1.5 second cap should be enough i hope and 5.3 still beat countdown, if not will tweak more.
	- Omega via svn r12400: More accurate fortification loop timers Mark of chaos tank swap voice only for tanks, or for users who turn tank filter off, otherwise voices can be highly distracting to people trying to listen for other things like nova (which often happens at SAME TIME as tank swaps/mark of chaos).
	- Omega via svn r12399: Fix a bug where nether energy would spam when the boss cast ANYTHING on himself. oops.
	- Omega via svn r12398: Fix stupid
	- Omega via svn r12397: Also do voice alert for all replicating fortified novas
	- Omega via svn r12396: CN update
	- ultrashining via svn r12395: zhTW update
	- nbluewiz via svn r12394: # koKR update.
	- Omega via svn r12393: Text shorten to fix an overrun
	- Omega via svn r12392: Comment tweak
	- Omega via svn r12391: GUI refactoring. Options split into better sorting. users should be able to navigate GUI and more easily find what they are looking for now. Raid warnings are now JUST raid warnings. special warnings are now just special warnings. Voice alerts have their own area.
	- Omega via svn r12390: Small antispam pass
	- Omega via svn r12389: Missed some force nova stuff
	- Omega via svn r12388: Fix RBW sync
	- Omega via svn r12387: #Margok Update *Change branded yell to always show, even for 1 stack *Changed branded fortification to always special warn at 5 or more, instead of 7. *Fixed accelerated assault showing as a personal stack warning when in fact it's boss count warning. *Fixed nether energy showing personal stack warning when it's a count warning *Added timers/count for 2nd and 3rd nova's when fortified *Added voice warnings for branded *Added extra range check updates for better switch to 5 yard when chaos and nova happen at same time and tank isn't full out of range yet. *Fixed bug where accelerated assault taunt warning would call a bad taunt too close to mark of chaos cast. *Fixed bug where mark of chaos taunt warning would report unknown target. use boss name as target since boss stacks reason for swap. *Fixed bug where first infinite darkness timer maybe 2 seconds late

	- Omega via svn r12378: layout
	- Omega via svn r12377: Add global override option to always play ALL voice alerts, regardless of specific boss mod options. Request for raid leaders or just players in general to know what's going on EVERYWHERE, not just their specific role.
	- Omega via svn r12376: Some micro optimizes
	- Omega via svn r12375: Some sounds, at least the ones findable with google. do to lack of casc explorers for mac os x i'm unable to find sound paths myself. if they aren't easily obtainable on internet they don't get added (which is why I didn't add any at all during mop).
	- Omega via svn r12374: CN update
	- Omega via svn r12373: Remove locals for removed update notification disable. Activate notices on later revisinos of koragh and margok

	- nbluewiz via svn r12358: # koKR update.
	- Omega via svn r12357: Change bunch of move warnings to new "dodge" warning. big difference between dodging an attack, and moving from shit on ground, warning clarity important. Fixed bug where dispel warning was firing for classes that can't dispel poisons on kyrak
	- Omega via svn r12356: Fix bug
	- Omega via svn r12355: bw version
	- nbluewiz via svn r12354: # koKR update.
	- Omega via svn r12353: comment this out for now. sometimes boss mcs on 1, 3, 5 7, sometimes 2, 4, 6, 8. need to find cause of this. need to see if maybe ballsforgot needs +1. did not video so can't see if ballsforgot is cause of this.
	- Omega via svn r12352: Give frost target, because we can. Although no special warnings because it really doesn't matter much. if you are close to this person it's going to hit you and you can do nothing about you. only has initial damage so warning near you not help you avoid any damage or danger.
	- Omega via svn r12351: Spam reduce. very common on mythic for soaker jump in and out of barrier to get heals.
	- Omega via svn r12350: delay fel yell more
	- nbluewiz via svn r12349: # revert
	- nbluewiz via svn r12348: # typo

	- Omega via svn r12343: fix maybe
	- Omega via svn r12342: speed up icon
	- Omega via svn r12341: dont print own whisper
	- Omega via svn r12340: Fix icon option
	- Omega via svn r12339: Fix impossible lua error. literally impossible, but it's happening some fucking how
	- Omega via svn r12338: missed that version
	- Omega via svn r12337: Support banned mods in voice packs too, to prevent loading double voice packs (example, KiwiBeta vs Kiwi).
	- Omega via svn r12336: Add icon option for crystal barrage for phase 1 and 2 (tectus, and shards). disabled in phase 3 because motes can be messy, especially if their timers get out of sync then very very messy. Icons on motes more useful in phase 3 anyways since too many barrages at once in many diff directions.
	- nbluewiz via svn r12335: # fix gtfo.
	- Omega via svn r12334: Request
	- Omega via svn r12333: Improve margok status whisper to not say 2 bosses on non mythic

	- tandanu via svn r12330: increment alpha version
