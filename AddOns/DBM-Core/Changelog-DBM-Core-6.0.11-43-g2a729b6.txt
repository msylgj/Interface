	- Omega via svn r12352: Give frost target, because we can. Although no special warnings because it really doesn't matter much. if you are close to this person it's going to hit you and you can do nothing about you. only has initial damage so warning near you not help you avoid any damage or danger.
	- Omega via svn r12351: Spam reduce. very common on mythic for soaker jump in and out of barrier to get heals.

	- Omega via svn r12338: missed that version

	- Omega via svn r12336: Add icon option for crystal barrage for phase 1 and 2 (tectus, and shards). disabled in phase 3 because motes can be messy, especially if their timers get out of sync then very very messy. Icons on motes more useful in phase 3 anyways since too many barrages at once in many diff directions.

	- tandanu via svn r12330: increment alpha version
